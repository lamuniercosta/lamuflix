# Codebase Design

Design **deep modules**: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface. Use this language and these principles wherever code is being designed or restructured. The aim is leverage for callers, locality for maintainers, and testability for everyone.

## Glossary

Use these terms exactly — don't substitute "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Consistent language is the whole point.

**Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation. Deliberately scale-agnostic: a method, class, project, or tier-spanning slice. _Avoid_: unit, component, service.

**Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module correctly: the type signature, but also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance characteristics. _Avoid_: API, signature. Note this is broader than the C# `interface` keyword — a C# `interface` declaration captures only the type-level surface.

**Implementation** — what's inside a module, its body of code. Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can be a small adapter with a large implementation (a MongoDB-backed repository) or a large adapter with a small implementation (an in-memory fake). Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic; "implementation" otherwise.

**Depth** — leverage at the interface: the amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per unit of interface they have to learn. A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits behind a small interface, **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** _(Michael Feathers)_ — a place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place; the *location* at which a module's interface lives. Where to put the seam is its own design decision, distinct from what goes behind it. _Avoid_: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded context).

**Adapter** — a concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam. Describes *role* (what slot it fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage** — what callers get from depth: more capability per unit of interface they learn. One implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate in one place rather than spreading across callers. Fix once, fixed everywhere.

## Deep vs shallow

**Deep module** = small interface + lots of implementation:

```
┌─────────────────────┐
│   Small Interface   │  ← Few methods, simple params
├─────────────────────┤
│                     │
│  Deep Implementation│  ← Complex logic hidden
│                     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Shallow module** = large interface + little implementation (avoid):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│       Large Interface           │  ← Many methods, complex params
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Thin Implementation            │  ← Just passes through
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

When designing an interface, ask:

- Can I reduce the number of methods?
- Can I simplify the parameters?
- Can I hide more complexity inside?

## Principles

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally composed of small, mockable, swappable parts — they just aren't part of the interface. A module can have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests — `internal` + `InternalsVisibleTo` is the C# expression of this) as well as the **external seam** at its interface.
- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam. If you want to test *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.
- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam unless something actually varies across it. This cuts directly against the reflexive .NET habit of declaring an `IFooService` for every `FooService`: if the only "second adapter" is an NSubstitute mock in a test that just re-states the setup, the seam is hypothetical — either find a real second adapter (an in-memory fake used across many tests, a Testcontainers-backed integration path) or delete the interface and depend on the class.

## Designing for testability

Good interfaces make testing natural:

1. **Accept dependencies, don't create them.**

   ```csharp
   // Testable — dependencies arrive through the constructor or parameters
   public sealed class OrderProcessor(IPaymentGateway gateway, TimeProvider clock)
   {
       public Task<Receipt> ProcessAsync(Order order, CancellationToken ct) { … }
   }

   // Hard to test — creates its own dependencies, pins its own clock
   public sealed class OrderProcessor
   {
       public Task<Receipt> ProcessAsync(Order order)
       {
           var gateway = new StripeGateway();
           var now = DateTime.UtcNow; // untestable time
           …
       }
   }
   ```

   The same rule covers time (`TimeProvider`, not `DateTime.UtcNow`), randomness (injected seeded `Random`), and I/O (injected `HttpMessageHandler`, not `new HttpClient()`).

2. **Return results, don't produce side effects.**

   ```csharp
   // Testable — pure decision, caller applies it
   public static Discount CalculateDiscount(Cart cart) { … }

   // Hard to test — mutates state in place
   public static void ApplyDiscount(Cart cart)
   {
       cart.Total -= discount;
   }
   ```

   In C#, `record` types and `readonly` structs make the return-a-result style cheap.

3. **Small surface area.** Fewer methods = fewer tests needed. Fewer params = simpler test setup.

## Relationships

- A **Module** has exactly one **Interface** (the surface it presents to callers and tests).
- **Depth** is a property of a **Module**, measured against its **Interface**.
- A **Seam** is where a **Module**'s **Interface** lives.
- An **Adapter** sits at a **Seam** and satisfies the **Interface**.
- **Depth** produces **Leverage** for callers and **Locality** for maintainers.

## Rejected framings

- **Depth as ratio of implementation-lines to interface-lines** (Ousterhout): rewards padding the implementation. We use depth-as-leverage instead.
- **"Interface" as the C# `interface` keyword or a class's public members**: too narrow — interface here includes every fact a caller must know.
- **"Boundary"**: overloaded with DDD's bounded context. Say **seam** or **interface**.
