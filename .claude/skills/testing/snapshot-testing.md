# Verify Snapshot Testing

Use Verify for complex response objects where manual assertions would be fragile.

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task GetOrder_MatchesSnapshot()
{
    // Arrange
    await SeedOrder(fixture);

    // Act
    var response = await _client.GetAsync("/api/orders/known-id");
    var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

    // Assert — compares against a stored .verified.txt file
    await Verify(content);
}
```

On first run, Verify creates a `.verified.txt` file. On subsequent runs, it compares output. If the output changes, the test fails and shows a diff.
