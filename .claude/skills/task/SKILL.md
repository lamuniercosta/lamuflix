name: task
description: The entry point for any new task. Takes a tracker-neutral task id and (optionally) a branch type, reads the task via the configured tracker (github, youtrack, or none), creates a correctly-named branch off the latest default branch (feature/bug/hotfix) in its own git worktree so tasks and agents can run in parallel, then hands off to the mandatory /grill-with-docs alignment step. Also handles the rebase step before a PR. Use when the user gives a task id, says "start task", "create a branch for", "new feature/bug/hotfix", or "rebase before PR".

# Task

The **first step of every task.** Turns a tracker task (or a description) into a ready-to-work branch in its own git worktree, kicks off the mandatory alignment grill, and later keeps the branch current before a PR. Invoke this skill instead of calling the scripts by hand — it orchestrates them. Intake runs from the repo root; everything after it runs from the task worktree. The scripts need PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`).

Retrieval is **tracker-neutral**. `harness.yml` `tracker` is the repository-wide source of truth — `github` (default), `youtrack`, or `none`. There is no CLI tracker override and no `task.tracker` setting.

## Parameters

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

- **id** — the tracker task id. GitHub: a numeric issue number, e.g. `142`. YouTrack: a readable id, e.g. `DAH-123` (preserve case). Optional if a description is given directly. Do not pass an id when `tracker: none`.
- **type** (optional) — `feature` | `bug` | `hotfix`. If omitted, inferred by the provider: GitHub `bug`/`defect` labels → `bug`; YouTrack `Type = Bug` → `bug`; anything else → `feature`. Hotfix is always an explicit human call and is never inferred.

Typical invocation: `/task 142 feature`, `/task DAH-123`, or just `/task 142`.

## Prerequisites

Depends on `harness.yml` `tracker`:

- **`github`** (default) — the [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com), authenticated (`gh auth login`). No tokens, config files, or environment variables of your own — `gh` owns the credential.
- **`youtrack`** — `YOUTRACK_URL` and `YOUTRACK_TOKEN`. Token resolution checks process env, then on Windows the DPAPI file (`$env:USERPROFILE\.dotnet-agent-harness\youtrack-token`) and User-scope env in that order. The DPAPI file holds only the token; `YOUTRACK_URL` stays in the environment. The token must be a permanent token beginning with `perm:`. It is sent only as `Authorization: Bearer` — never in a URL, query string, error, log, or generated file. **Never print a live token.**
- **`none`** — no tracker contact. Description-only intake. Supplying a task id fails before any git mutation.

The tracker is **optional**. With no id to work from, pass a description straight through and everything below still applies:

```powershell
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -Description "Add upload retry" -Type feature
```

## 1. Intake — read the task

```powershell
./scripts/get-task.ps1 -TaskId 142
# YouTrack:
./scripts/get-task.ps1 -TaskId DAH-123
# -TaskId is canonical:
./scripts/get-task.ps1 -TaskId 142
```

`get-task.ps1` returns `Id`, `Summary`, `Description`, and `Type`. Use the summary and description as the source of truth. If the user also supplied a description, prefer theirs only when they say so; otherwise use the tracker summary. This text seeds `specs/<feature>/brief.md` when the change goes through the Spec Kit pipeline.

Do not call `gh` or YouTrack REST yourself — the script owns provider dispatch. Do not echo `YOUTRACK_TOKEN`.

## 2. Resolve the branch type

Use the `type` parameter when given; otherwise infer from the object `get-task.ps1` returned:

- **feature/** — new feature or enhancement
- **bug/** — bug fix
- **hotfix/** — urgent production fix

Hotfix is always an explicit human call.

## 3. Create the worktree (off the latest default branch)

```powershell
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -TaskId 142
# -TaskId is canonical:
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -TaskId 142
# force the type:
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -TaskId 142 -Type bug
# YouTrack readable id (case preserved in the branch name):
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -TaskId DAH-123
# override the description slug:
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -TaskId 142 -Description "Fix null ref on upload"
# create and push:
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -TaskId 142 -Push
# switch this checkout instead of creating a worktree:
./scripts/new-task-branch.ps1 -TaskId 142 -NoWorktree
```

The script fetches `origin`, resolves the remote's default branch, branches from it, and names the branch `{type}/{id}-{slug}` (GitHub `feature/142-…`, YouTrack `feature/DAH-123-…`). Description-only intake omits the id. It refuses to run over an existing branch. Id/fetch/config failures happen before any branch, worktree, git fetch, git push, or file mutation.

By default the branch is created in **its own git worktree** at `<repo>.worktrees/{type}-{id}-{slug}`, a sibling of the repo. **Everything after this step happens in that worktree** — `cd` into the path the script prints before writing any code, and run `dotnet tool restore` there, because each worktree restores its own tools.

Why a worktree: one checkout serialises tasks. A branch held by one agent blocks every other agent, and a dirty tree blocks intake entirely. Separate worktrees remove both limits, so a dirty main checkout is *not* an error in this mode — only under `-NoWorktree`, which switches the current checkout and keeps the old refusal.

Two things a fresh worktree does not inherit, because git does not carry gitignored files:

- **`harness.yml`** — the script copies it, and says so. Without it every configured threshold would silently revert to a harness default. If the main checkout has no `harness.yml`, the script warns that the worktree runs on defaults; that warning is not noise.
- **`.specify/`** — Spec Kit is a runtime dependency, so run `specify init` in the worktree before any `/speckit-*` step. The script warns when the main checkout has it and the worktree does not.

When the PR merges, clean up: `git worktree remove <path>`.

## 4. MANDATORY: grill the development

Once the worktree exists — working inside it from here on — **immediately run `/grill-with-docs`** — do not jump to a spec or code first. This is the essential "question the development" step: it interrogates the task (using the fetched title and body as raw input), settles vocabulary in `CONTEXT.md`, records any ADRs, and produces `specs/<feature>/brief.md`. The spec (`/speckit-specify`) is written from that settled output.

Do not proceed past this step until the grill concludes with shared understanding. For a tiny bug fix the grill is short — but it still happens.

## 5. Commit convention

Reference the task in every commit **subject** so the tracker links the work:

```
Add dark mode toggle (#142)
Add retry handling (DAH-123)
```

The reference is a **suffix, not a prefix**: a subject beginning with `#` is treated as a comment by git's editor-based commit path and gets silently stripped. GitHub auto-links `#142`; YouTrack links the readable id in parentheses. Description-only intake has no tracker suffix.

(Only commit when the user asks — the standard git safety rules still apply.)

## 6. Before a PR — rebase

Always bring the branch up to date so anything merged in the meantime is included:

```powershell
./scripts/rebase-task-branch.ps1 -Push
```

This fetches and rebases onto the remote default branch, then pushes. On conflicts it stops with next steps (`git rebase --continue` / `--abort`) — resolve, then re-run. The push forces with `--force-with-lease` only when the rebase rewrote history the remote branch already holds; a first push (no remote branch yet) is a plain `--set-upstream` push, so it does not trip a force-push guard. Only open the PR after a clean rebase and push.

GitHub remains the code host for remotes, branches, commits, pushes, and pull requests regardless of the issue tracker.

## YouTrack environment (Windows)

Run these snippets in a terminal yourself, not through the agent (the secret scanner flags permanent tokens in prompts, and interactive input requires a terminal).

### Hardened setup (recommended)

Stores the token encrypted with DPAPI so it is not visible in environment variables or registry queries. The file inherits the default ACLs of your user profile directory and is non-portable across machines or users (backup restores require running setup again).

```powershell
$youTrackUrl = 'https://lamuniercosta.youtrack.cloud'
$secureToken = Read-Host 'Paste the YouTrack permanent token' -AsSecureString
$tokenHandle = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($secureToken)

try {
    $plainToken = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringBSTR($tokenHandle)

    if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($plainToken) -or
        -not $plainToken.StartsWith('perm:', [StringComparison]::Ordinal)) {
        throw "Expected a YouTrack permanent token beginning with 'perm:'."
    }

    $dir = "$env:USERPROFILE\.dotnet-agent-harness"
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $dir -Force | Out-Null
    $secureToken | ConvertFrom-SecureString | Set-Content -Path "$dir\youtrack-token" -Encoding UTF8

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('YOUTRACK_URL', $youTrackUrl, 'User')
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('YOUTRACK_TOKEN', $null, 'User')
    Remove-Item Env:\YOUTRACK_TOKEN -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    Write-Host 'YouTrack token saved to DPAPI-encrypted file and user-scope YOUTRACK_URL was set.'
}
finally {
    if ($tokenHandle -ne [IntPtr]::Zero) {
        [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ZeroFreeBSTR($tokenHandle)
    }

    Remove-Variable plainToken, secureToken, tokenHandle -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}
```

### Basic setup (legacy)

One-time setup. It prompts without echoing the token, rejects non-permanent tokens, stores both variables for the Windows user, and makes them available to the current shell. Environment variables are plaintext process/user configuration, not a secret vault.

```powershell
$youTrackUrl = 'https://lamuniercosta.youtrack.cloud'
$secureToken = Read-Host 'Paste the YouTrack permanent token' -AsSecureString
$tokenHandle = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::SecureStringToBSTR($secureToken)

try {
    $plainToken = [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::PtrToStringBSTR($tokenHandle)

    if ([string]::IsNullOrWhiteSpace($plainToken) -or
        -not $plainToken.StartsWith('perm:', [StringComparison]::Ordinal)) {
        throw "Expected a YouTrack permanent token beginning with 'perm:'."
    }

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('YOUTRACK_URL', $youTrackUrl, 'User')
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('YOUTRACK_TOKEN', $plainToken, 'User')

    $env:YOUTRACK_URL = $youTrackUrl
    $env:YOUTRACK_TOKEN = $plainToken

    Write-Host 'YouTrack environment variables were set for this shell and the current Windows user.'
}
finally {
    if ($tokenHandle -ne [IntPtr]::Zero) {
        [Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ZeroFreeBSTR($tokenHandle)
    }

    Remove-Variable plainToken, secureToken, tokenHandle -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}
```

### Rotating the token

To rotate, revoke the old token in YouTrack, run Hardened setup to save the new token, and execute `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('YOUTRACK_TOKEN', $null, 'User')` to remove any lingering HKCU plaintext token. Close open shells or execute `Remove-Item Env:\YOUTRACK_TOKEN` to clear any stale process environment variables.

Never print `$env:YOUTRACK_TOKEN` or `$plainToken` to confirm the setup.

## Rules

- After the branch is created, `/grill-with-docs` is **mandatory** before any spec or code — never skip straight to `/speckit-specify` or implementation.
- Work in the worktree the script created, not the main checkout. Editing the main checkout puts the change on whatever branch that checkout happens to hold.
- Never create worktrees inside the repo. Git keeps them out of `git status`, but `dotnet build`, InspectCode, and every recursive glob still walk them, so one task's checkout lands in another task's gate results.
- Never branch from a stale local default branch — always from `origin/<default>` (the script fetches first).
- Never open a PR without rebasing first.
- Preserve the task reference in both the branch name and every commit subject.
- Never open or push a PR automatically — that is a human decision at gate 3.
- Never echo, log, or commit `YOUTRACK_TOKEN`.
