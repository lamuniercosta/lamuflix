  Testing strategy for .NET 10 applications. Covers xUnit v3, WebApplicationFactory
  for integration tests, Testcontainers for real database testing, Verify for
  snapshot testing, and the AAA pattern.

# Testing

Adapted from [codewithmukesh/dotnet-claude-kit](https://github.com/codewithmukesh/dotnet-claude-kit) (MIT).

## Map to the repo's stack first (read first)

The examples below use EF Core + Postgres illustratively. **Detect what the repo actually uses before writing a line** — run `$convention-learner`, or read one existing test in each test project. Fill this table in for the repo at hand:

| Concern | What to look for | Common choices |
|---|---|---|
| Test projects | the `tests/` layout and what each project is for | unit (+ `[Trait("Category","Property")]` for FsCheck), integration, acceptance |
| Real DB in tests | how integration tests get a database | Testcontainers (preferred), a shared instance (avoid) |
| External HTTP | how outbound calls are faked | WireMock.NET, a stub `HttpMessageHandler` |
| Integration host | how the app is booted in-process | `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` |
| Time | how `TimeProvider` is controlled | `FakeTimeProvider` (`Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing`) |

Three concerns are not detected — the constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, Principle IX) fixes them, and `.claude/rules/pipeline/test-assertions.mdc` has the details:

| Concern | Use | Forbidden |
|---|---|---|
| Assertions | Shouldly (`Assert.Collection` is the one xUnit assert still allowed) | FluentAssertions, raw xUnit `Assert` |
| Mocks | NSubstitute | Moq, FakeItEasy |
| Test data | AutoFixture (anonymous values), Faker.Net (realistic values) | Bogus, hand-rolled random values |

**Match the existing choice — do not introduce a second one.** Two assertion libraries or two mocking libraries in one suite is a convention failure the `code-review` Standards axis will flag, and it is the most common way generated tests read as foreign.

Two rules that hold regardless of stack:

- **Never mock the data-access driver for behaviour that depends on real query translation or serialisation.** A mocked collection or `DbSet` will happily lie about ID handling, type mapping, and what the query engine actually does. Use a real engine via Testcontainers.
- Section comments `// arrange` `// act` `// assert` are the one exception to the no-comments rule in `coding-conventions`.

Acceptance scenarios, when the repo uses them, come from `$gherkin`.

## Core Principles

1. **Integration tests are the highest-value tests** — A single `WebApplicationFactory` test covers routing, binding, validation, business logic, and persistence in one shot. Start here before writing unit tests.
2. **Real databases in tests** — Use Testcontainers to spin up real PostgreSQL/SQL Server instances. In-memory providers hide real bugs (transactions, constraints, SQL generation).
3. **AAA pattern is mandatory** — Every test has three clearly separated sections: Arrange, Act, Assert. No mixing.
4. **Test behavior, not implementation** — Tests should survive refactoring. Test what the system does, not how it does it.

## Decision Guide

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|
| Testing an API endpoint | `WebApplicationFactory` integration test |
| Testing business logic in isolation | Unit test with fakes/stubs |
| Database-dependent tests | Testcontainers (real DB) |
| Complex response validation | Verify snapshot testing |
| Time-dependent logic | `FakeTimeProvider` |
| External API dependency | `WireMock.Net` or `HttpMessageHandler` stub |
| Parameterized test cases | `[Theory]` with `[InlineData]` or `[MemberData]` |
| Test data setup | AutoFixture (`Fixture`, `[AutoData]`); a builder only for domain invariants it cannot satisfy |
| Shared expensive fixture | `IClassFixture<T>` with `IAsyncLifetime` |
