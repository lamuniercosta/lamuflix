Usage: run-property-tests.ps1 [OPTIONS]

Runs dotnet test with filter Category=Property, ONE TEST PROJECT AT A TIME.
Every discovered test project is covered without naming them.

Per project on purpose: a whole-solution run interleaves each assembly's
output, and the signals that classify a run are per assembly while the exit
code is not - which made "this assembly had no matching tests" and "that
assembly died before reporting" indistinguishable.

OPTIONS:
  -Project <path>   A single test .csproj (default: every discovered one).
                    A solution is rejected - omit -Project instead.
  -Category <name>  Trait category to filter on (default: Property)
  -Help             Show this help

EXAMPLES:
  ./scripts/run-property-tests.ps1
  ./scripts/run-property-tests.ps1 -Project tests/My.UnitTests/My.UnitTests.csproj

# Running the whole solution in a single `dotnet test` interleaves every
# assembly's output, and the signals that classify a run - the no-match message,
# the counts - are per assembly while the exit code is not. That made "this
# assembly had no matching tests" indistinguishable from "that assembly died
# before reporting", which produced a SKIPPED verdict over a solution whose
# property tests had passed, and later a SKIPPED verdict over a failed run.
#
# Enumerating projects costs one `dotnet test` each and makes the whole class of
# confusion impossible: one project, one result, no interleaving to untangle.
# @() at every assignment, not inside Get-TestProjects: PowerShell unwraps a
# one-element array on return, and `.Count` on the resulting string throws under
# Set-StrictMode. A repo with exactly one test project - the common shape - would
# crash before running anything, and the fixture's two projects hid it.
#                    vvv wraps the WHOLE conditional, not each branch: a branch
# emitting a one-element array still unwraps to a string on its way out of the
# if-expression, which is how this same trap survived being "fixed" once already.
