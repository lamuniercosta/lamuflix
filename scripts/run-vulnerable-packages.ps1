# Vulnerable-package gate.
#
# Half of what a hosted static-analysis service contributes over Roslyn +
# InspectCode is supply-chain: a CVE in a transitive dependency that no code
# analyzer will ever see. This gate covers that half locally, with no account.
# CodeQL covers the other half (dataflow) post-PR in CI.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/run-vulnerable-packages.ps1
#   ./scripts/run-vulnerable-packages.ps1 -Severity High
#   ./scripts/run-vulnerable-packages.ps1 -IncludeTransitive:$false
#
# Exit 0 = no findings at or above -Severity. Exit 1 = findings, or the scan
# could not run. Exit 2 = SKIPPED when the gate is disabled. A scan that could
# not run is never reported as a pass.

Fails on any known-vulnerable NuGet package at or above the given severity.
Defaults come from harness.yml (gates.vulnerablePackages). With no -Severity,
ANY advisory fails - a known CVE in a shipped dependency is not a warning.
