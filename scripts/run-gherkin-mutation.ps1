# Mutates Then clauses in acceptance .feature files and verifies Reqnroll tests fail.
# Exits 1 when mutation survivors are found (tests still pass after mutation); exits 0 when all killed.
#
# "Killed" is only meaningful against a baseline: every scenario is first run
# UNMUTATED and must pass, because a scenario that fails anyway - or a filter
# that matched zero tests - makes the mutated run's failure uninformative.
# Reqnroll compiles .feature files into code-behind at build time, so the
# mutated run rebuilds before testing; without that rebuild the mutation never
# executes and every mutant "survives".
