        2. The git toplevel.
        3. The parent of scripts/, so the gates still work outside git
           (-All and -Files need no change detection).

      The override exists because rule 2 walks UP. When the project being gated
      is nested inside a larger repository - a monorepo package, or this
      harness's own fixtures/BadCode - git reports the OUTER root, and every
      gate then looks for its config in a directory that does not have it. The
      gates correctly refuse to run at that point ("GATE NOT WIRED"), which is
      the right behaviour and a confusing one to debug. Setting
      HARNESS_REPO_ROOT pins them to the project you actually mean.

function Get-TestRunOutcome {
    <#
      Classifies ONE `dotnet test` run of ONE project, so a gate can tell
      "nothing to verify" from "verified something".

      Single-project by contract. Handed the interleaved output of a whole
      solution it cannot be correct, because the signals it reads are per
      assembly and the exit code is not. Callers enumerate projects with
      Get-TestProjects and classify each separately.

        Ran            - at least one test executed; judge it on the exit code
        NothingMatched - nothing ran: either the filter matched nothing, or every
                         match was skipped. Skipped says which.
        Inconclusive   - nothing ran, nothing explains why, and the run FAILED

      Skipped tests are never counted as executed. A suite where every property
      test carries [Fact(Skip = "...")] verified nothing, and reporting that as a
      pass is the vacuous green this whole gate exists to prevent.

      A no-match line only means SKIPPED when the process SUCCEEDED. One project
      is still several runs when it multi-targets, so a no-match on one framework
      can sit beside a crashed host on another - and per-project scheduling does
      not separate those. Failing closed is the only reading that cannot hide a
      failure behind "nothing to verify".

      This does drop an accommodation for runners that supposedly exit non-zero
      when a filter matches nothing. That claim was inherited and never verified;
      the SDKs this targets exit 0, checked directly. If one does not, the gate
      says GATE COULD NOT RUN with remediation rather than silently skipping -
      loud and wrong beats quiet and wrong.

      Counting executed tests, rather than trusting the "no test matches" line, is
      what makes this correct on a solution with more than one test assembly. With
      two test projects, the one without matching tests prints that line while the
      other runs its tests normally - and matching the line alone reported SKIPPED
      while property tests had demonstrably passed. Two or more test assemblies is
      the ordinary shape of a .NET solution, so that read the gate as permanently
      skipped for most consumers.

      A run that matched nothing prints no summary line at all, which is why zero
      executed is not by itself enough to conclude either way.

      Counts Passed + Failed rather than Total, for two reasons:

      Total includes SKIPPED tests, so a suite where every property test carries
      [Fact(Skip = "...")] would report "2 tests executed" having run no test
      body at all - the same vacuous pass this function exists to prevent.

      And it reads both summary formats. The current one is a single line
      ("Failed: 0, Passed: 2, Skipped: 0, Total: 2"); older VSTest output breaks
      the counts across lines under a "Total tests: N" heading, which a Total-only
      match misses entirely - turning a healthy run into Unknown, and a healthy
      repo into exit 1.
